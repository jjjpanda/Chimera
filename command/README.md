Serves the web app and handles authentication, RBAC, and session management.

# API

Three access levels: public, session (`authorize`), admin (`requireAdmin`). Auth/RBAC/sessions live here; other services validate against this service's `auth`/`sessions` tables via [lib](../lib).

- login/logout, session verification
- first-admin bootstrap + admin recovery (`/authorization/setup`)
- admin-only user and session management (create/list/update/delete users; list/revoke sessions)
- theme and password changes
- list cameras (RTSP credentials stripped) for the web app

`setup_TOKEN` is required — the service won't boot without it ([server.js](server.js)). A valid token bootstraps the first admin only when no admin exists; it cannot reset or take over an existing account. `/setup` is public but rate-limited.

# Web app

- Serves the compiled SPA (`dist/`, built from `frontend/`) at `/`, `/login`, and every app path; `/res` serves static assets.
- Client-side React ([frontend/App.jsx](frontend/App.jsx)); unauthenticated visitors redirect to `/login`.
- Sections: Home, Live, Clip Maker, Recordings, Stats, Schedule, Objects, and an admin-only Admin (hidden unless role is `admin`). Mobile shows a subset.

# Config

`command_ON`, `command_PORT`, `command_HOST`, `command_PROXY_ON`, `command_COOKIE_SECURE`, `SECRETKEY`, `setup_TOKEN`; see [../env.example](../env.example).

`command_COOKIE_SECURE` sets the `Secure` flag on the auth cookie. It is config, not `req.secure`: `trust proxy` makes Express read `X-Forwarded-Proto`, which a client can prepend to, and the gateway's `xfwd` appends rather than overwrites — so the request cannot be trusted to describe its own transport. Set it `true` whenever browsers reach the site over HTTPS regardless of where TLS terminates, `false` for plain-HTTP deploys.
