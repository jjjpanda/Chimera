Serves the web app and handles authentication, RBAC, and session management.

# API

Three access levels: public, session (`authorize`), admin (`requireAdmin`). Auth/RBAC/sessions live here; other services validate against this service's `auth`/`sessions` tables via [lib](../lib).

- login/logout, session verification
- first-admin bootstrap + admin recovery (`/authorization/setup`)
- admin-only user and session management (create/list/update/delete users; list/revoke sessions)
- theme and password changes
- list cameras (RTSP credentials stripped) for the web app

`setup_TOKEN` is required — the service won't boot without it ([server.js](server.js)). A valid token bootstraps the first admin only when no admin exists; it cannot reset or take over an existing account. `/setup` is public but rate-limited.

# Web app

- Serves the compiled SPA (`dist/`, built from `frontend/`) at `/`, `/login`, and every app path; `/res` serves static assets.
- Client-side React ([frontend/App.jsx](frontend/App.jsx)); unauthenticated visitors redirect to `/login`.
- Sections: Home, Live, Clip Maker, Recordings, Stats, Schedule, Objects, and an admin-only Admin (hidden unless role is `admin`). Mobile shows a subset.

# Config
